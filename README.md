# Kohana REST Client

The purpose the Kohana REST Client project is to provide a simple way to work
with remote REST services from the Kohana PHP web framework.

This project is currently being developed against:

* [Kohana][] 3.0.7 (current stable tag)

In anticipation that one day this work may be included in the Kohana mainline,
this project aims to closely follow the same general spirit of the Kohana
framework itself as regards code organization, in-line documentation, and code
formatting. To this end, suggestions are welcome.
